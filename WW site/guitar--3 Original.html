			Over the years, humans have made music an important part of their lives. 
			Whether it be for fun or celebration, there has been music in every culture. 
			Scholars speculate that music was the first form of language. 
			Drums, flutes, and pipes were the original instruments. As technology was advancing, the 
			instruments were progressing too. An instrument that came out of that technology was 
			the electric guitar.   Acoustic guitars had already been invented, but they were not 
			loud enough for concerts.  When musicians played in concert the drums and brass instruments 
			would drown out the guitars. </p>

			The guitar was the most popular instrument in the early 1900s.  Later in the 1930s the desire 
			to make the acoustic guitar louder began.  When these two men collaborated on their ideas, the 
			guitar was born.  George Beauchamp a musician and machinist, along with Adolph Rickenbacker an 
			electrical engineer got together and designed the electric guitar.  1931, the “Frying Pan” was 
			created.  It was called the “Frying Pan” since it had a flat circular body and a long steel neck.<br>

			<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #641E16; font-family: serif">1n 1937, Beauchamp was awarded a patent for his design ideas.  This allowed other companies to 
			create and produce versions of the guitar. 

			Acoustic guitars were designed with a hollow or semi-hollow body.  The electric guitars needed to 
			have a solid or semi-solid body.  The hollow chamber in the middle was no longer needed since it 
			did not require a cavity to produce sounds.  If they were hollow, the body would vibrate and it 
			would cause the strings to vibrate unintentionally.  

			A physical force that governs electrically charged particles is the science behind the sound.  
			This is all based on electromagnetism.  The body needs to have two or three bar shaped strips 
			located where you strum the instrument.  These are called pickups.  These strips are wrapped 
			with coper wire which emits a magnetic field.  Once strummed, the vibration is disrupted and a 
			sound is created.  The string’s sound is determined by its rate of vibration or frequency.  
			The strings were made of steel.

        The <span style="color: darkgreen">guitar</span> is one of the most fun instraments to play today. 
			A guitar is a instrament that has six strings.  
			You make music with the guitar by plucking one of the strings, and holding a string down on one of the spaces.  Each time you pluck the string while holding it, you will get a differne style of sound.

	        In 1966, a musician from London was looking for a heavier sound.  His name was Jimi Hendrix.  Hendrix already owned a Fender Stratocaster and his Marshall amplifier, but he wanted more. </p>
        
            <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="Hendrix.png" width="100" alt="Hendrix"></p>
        
		<p> Jimi Hendrix pioneered and popularized many new techniques with the guitar, including use of amplifier feedback, wah-wah pedals, and playing chords with one’s thumb instead of the standard barre chord method. With the new sounds of the electric guitar or base guitar it made the profound impact on the history of modern music today. Today’s guitars, bass or electric are an integral part of every band.

        The guitar became a battlefield of competition and an institution as well.  Players were on a 
		quest to be the best. As the debate to find “Who is the best?” goes on, each era has its favorites.  
		Musicians such as Les Paul, Van Halen, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix 
		are a few that would come to mind. <br>
